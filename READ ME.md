Le Petit Renard (The Little Fox) Desktop Pet
Le Petit Renard (The Little Fox)
A simple, lightweight, and poetic desktop companion inspired by the philosophy of The Little Prince. This pet stays on your screen, ready to interact with your clicks, turning your desktop into a small piece of the night sky.

 Core Features
Always-on-Top: Stays visible on your desktop without obstructing other applications.
Poetic Interaction: Clicking your desktop makes the stars fall, and the Little Fox will chase it, click the fox, and it will smile.

Inspiration: The Fox and the Laughing Stars
My core inspiration comes directly from Antoine de Saint-Exupéry's The Little Prince, specifically the relationship with the Fox and its message about "taming" and friendship.

The central interactive mechanism is drawn from the Fox's unforgettable farewell quote:

"« La nuit, quand tu regarderas le ciel, puisque j'habiterai dans l'une d'elles, puisque je rirai sur l'une d'elles, ce sera pour toi comme si toutes les étoiles riaient. Tu auras, toi, des étoiles qui savent rire ! »"— Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, The Little Prince

This translates beautifully to:

"And when your sorrow is comforted (time soothes all sorrows) you will be content that you have known me. You will always be my friend. You will want to laugh with me. And you will open your window, sometimes, just for pleasure... And your friends will be very surprised to see you smiling as you look up at the sky. But you will explain to them: 'Yes, the stars always make me laugh!'"

The project aims to embody this concept: a simple click on the desktop brings a moment of joy (the "laughing star") that the Fox companion reacts to.


Development Flow (AI-Assisted)

This project was successfully completed through detailed collaboration with an AI assistant. My role focused on defining the project scope and setting precise technical requirements for the AI to execute:

Architecture Mandate: I instructed the AI to use Python and the PyQt6 framework to build a modern, simple desktop application, specifically prohibiting any complex AI/LLM integration to keep the project lightweight.

Core GUI Requirements: I provided a rigid list of features for the main window, demanding a frameless, always-on-top window that supports mouse-based dragging and maintains a fixed size (e.g., $200 \times 200$ pixels).

Interaction Logic: I defined the required user interactions, tasking the AI with generating the code for a right-click menu (for clean exit) and implementing the left-click/double-click event handlers for future interactive animations.

Code Structure & Deployment: I enforced constraints on the code output, requiring a single, immediately runnable Python file and clear instructions on how to use PyInstaller to bundle the final .exe application.
